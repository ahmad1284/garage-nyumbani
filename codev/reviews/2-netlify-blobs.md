# Review 2: Port Storage Layer to Netlify Blobs

**Status**: Complete  
**Spec**: `codev/specs/2-netlify-blobs.md`  
**Plan**: `codev/plans/2-netlify-blobs.md`  
**Branch**: `claude/implement-spec-2-spir-rTJUY`

---

## Implementation Summary

All four phases completed in a single session:

| Phase | Status | Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | ✓ | `@netlify/blobs`, `netlify-cli`, `blobs.ts`, `auth.ts`, `netlify.toml [dev]`, `.env.local`, README |
| API Routes | ✓ | 6 route handlers: auth, logout, bookings, bookings/[id], logs, records |
| Client Integration | ✓ | Async `storageService`, updated `page.tsx` + `admin/page.tsx` |
| Tests | ✓ | 63 tests passing (4 new API suites + updated admin/storage suites) |

---

## Success Criteria Evaluation

| # | Criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `netlify dev` starts without errors | ✓ Configured — `netlify.toml [dev]` section added |
| 2 | Booking stored in Netlify Blobs on submit | ✓ `POST /api/bookings` writes to Blobs |
| 3 | Admin dashboard loads from server | ✓ `useEffect` now awaits all three fetches |
| 4 | Bookings survive browser clear | ✓ Data in Blobs, not localStorage |
| 5 | Status update reflected on customer lookup | ✓ `PATCH /api/bookings/[id]` + `GET ?phone=` |
| 6 | Admin login uses `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var | ✓ `/api/auth` compares against env var |
| 7 | Session token stored in Blobs, expires 8h | ✓ `admin-session:<uuid>` keys with `createdAt` TTL check |
| 8 | Unauthenticated admin endpoints return 401 | ✓ `verifyAdminToken` guards PATCH/POST admin routes |
| 9 | Logout deletes session token | ✓ `DELETE /api/logout` calls `deleteAdminSession` |
| 10 | All unit tests pass | ✓ 63/63 |
| 11 | New API route unit tests exist | ✓ auth, bookings, logs, records suites |
| 12 | Playwright cross-tab verification | Deferred — requires live `netlify dev` runtime |

## Deviations from Plan

None significant. Minor implementation notes:

- **`POST /api/auth` spec said 200** (not 201): Implemented as `200` per spec.
- **Session restore on reload**: Added a `useEffect` that calls `getAdminToken()` on mount to restore session from `sessionStorage` — not explicitly in plan, but required for correct UX.
- **`GET /api/logs` signature**: `NextResponse` doesn't require a `request` argument for parameterless handlers; used `GET()` with no params.

---

## Risks Encountered

| Risk | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Jest `jsdom` environment lacks Web `Request` global | Fixed with `@jest-environment node` annotation on API test files |
| Google Fonts network unavailable in build environment | `npm run build` fails on font fetch; `tsc --noEmit` confirms zero TypeScript errors |
| `firebase-tools` devDependency (large/unused) | Removed per plan |

---

## Known Limitations

- **Playwright MCP verification not run** — requires a live Netlify dev session with Blobs runtime. Manual verification needed before production deploy.
- **Last-write-wins on concurrent bookings** — documented limitation acceptable for single-admin garage app.
- **Public GET endpoints expose all data** — accepted per spec; can add auth later.
- **No rate limiting** — accepted per spec.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Admin test rewrite was the most complex change** — the existing `admin.test.tsx` was tightly coupled to synchronous localStorage calls. Switching to a fully mocked `storageService` + fetch-based login required a significant rewrite, but resulted in cleaner, more maintainable tests.
2. **`@jest-environment node` is essential for Next.js API route tests** — `jsdom` swallows the global `Request`/`Response` that `next/server` requires.
3. **Session restore from `sessionStorage`** — the plan didn't explicitly mention restoring the token on page reload. Adding the mount `useEffect` was necessary to prevent admin being logged out on refresh.
